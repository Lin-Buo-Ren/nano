name: nano-strict
summary: Small, friendly text editor (Strict Confinement)
description: |
  GNU nano is an easy-to-use text editor originally designed as a replacement
  for Pico, the ncurses-based editor from the non-free mailer package Pine
  (itself now available under the Apache License as Alpine).

  However, GNU nano also implements many features missing in Pico, including:
    - undo/redo
    - line numbering
    - syntax coloring
    - soft-wrapping of overlong lines
    - selecting text by holding Shift
    - interactive search and replace (with regular expression support)
    - a go-to line (and column) command
    - support for multiple file buffers
    - auto-indentation
    - tab completion of filenames and search terms
    - toggling features while running
    - and full internationalization support

  This snap ships GNU nano in strict confinement mode, this means that it can only access non-directly-under-hidden-files under your home directory and (optionally) files under `/mnt` and `/media` via the `removable-media` interface, however in contrast with the `nano` snap it is installable in Ubuntu Core systems.

  Run the following command in a terminal to create an alias of the `tree` command after installing the snap:

      sudo snap alias nano-strict nano

  Note that if you just removed nano from APT distribution you will have to run the following command to regenerate GNU Bash's command search hash so that it will fall back to the command provided by the snap:

      hash -r

  simply logout and re-login the user session will work.

  This is NOT an official nano distribution, refer the issue tracker for any problems regarding the use of this snap:
